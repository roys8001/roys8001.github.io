I am a 3rd Year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.tamu.edu) at Texas A&M University, College Station . Previously, I have completed my Master of Science in Statistics from the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.iitk.ac.in/math/) at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and Bachelor of Science in the same discipline from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.sxccal.edu/faculty-statistics/) at St. Xavier's College, Kolkata. 

My research interests include Bayesian modelling, functional data analysis, graphical models and causal discovery. Recently, Iâ€™ve also been interested in transfer learning and domain adaptation problems.  

I am working with [Dr Yang Ni](https://web.stat.tamu.edu/~yni/) and [Dr Raymond K.W. Wong](https://raymondkww.github.io) and both of them have been wonderful influences on my life. Earlier, I have worked under the guidance of [Dr Amit Mitra](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~amitra/) of IIT Kanpur as a part of my master's thesis work.

For the summer of 2020, I was a research intern under [Dr Abhik Ghosh](https://www.isical.ac.in/~abhik.ghosh/) of Interdisciplinary Statistical Research Unit at ISI, Kolkata.
